	<h2>Shipping & Returns</h2>
	<h3>Returns Policy:</h3>
		<p>You may return any item within 30 days of delivery for a full refund, as long as the original Rekloth tag is still attached. If you have removed your tag but still want to return your purchase, we will be happy to consign it for you!
<br><br>
		We'll also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.). 
<br><br>
		You should expect to receive your refunded amount within four weeks of shipment, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process the refund request (5 to 10 business days).
<br>
<br>
		Please Return to the address:
<br><br>
		Rekloth LLC.
<br>
		616 E Creosote Dr.
<br>
		Phoenix, AZ 85085</p>
<br>

	<h3>Shipping:</h3>
		<p>We currently only accept consignment and ship in the United States of America.
<br><br>
		When you place an order, we will estimate shipping and delivery dates for you based on your items and the shipping options you choose. Depending on the shipping provider you choose, shipping date estimates may appear on the shipping quotes page.
<br><br>
		All shipments are flat rate and one price for you in regards to the cost of shipping and handling. A shipment of an order of more than one item may possibly come in more than one box or bag depending on the size, weight, or fragility of the individual items - you will not be charged per box or bag, only once through the original order.
<br>
<br>
<br>
		If we have not answered your question about returning your purchase, please <a href="contactus.html">Contact Us</a> with your order number and details about the product you would like to return.</p>
